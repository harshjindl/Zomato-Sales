**Situation:**

I analyzed a delivery performance dataset containing over 45,000 entries. The dataset included columns such as ID, Delivery_person_ID, Delivery_person_Age, Delivery_person_Ratings, Restaurant_latitude, Restaurant_longitude, Delivery_location_latitude, Delivery_location_longitude, Order_Date, Time_Ordered, Time_Order_picked, Weather_conditions, Road_traffic_density, Vehicle_condition, Type_of_order, Type_of_vehicle, multiple_deliveries, Festival, City, and Time_taken (min). The primary objective was to identify** key performance indicators (KPIs)**, perform thorough **data cleaning, and create visualizations** and **dashboards** to provide actionable insights into delivery performance.

**Action:**

**Data Cleaning:**

**Removed Blank Columns:** Eliminated any columns that were entirely blank to streamline the dataset.

**Handled NaN Values:** Addressed missing values by either removing rows with NaNs or imputing them based on the context.

**Key Performance Indicators:**

**Identified relevant KPIs** such as average time taken for deliveries, total number of orders, average delivery person rating, and preferred vehicle type.

Data Visualization and Dashboard Design:

Average Time Taken by Vehicle: Analyzed and visualized the average time taken for deliveries by different vehicle types.

Daily Performance by Age: Created a stacked bar chart to analyze delivery performance based on the age of the delivery persons.

Weather and Traffic Impact: Used a donut chart to analyze the impact of weather conditions and road traffic density on delivery times, highlighting how traffic jams significantly increase average delivery times.

Customer Rating Analysis: Created a stacked bar chart to analyze customer ratings based on the type of vehicle used for delivery.

Delivery Performance by Traffic Density: Analyzed delivery performance under different traffic conditions (high, medium, low, jam), demonstrating that traffic jams create the longest delivery times.

Key Performance Indicators Dashboard: Introduced a dashboard displaying total orders, average time taken, average rating, and preferred vehicle type.

**Resolution:**

The data analysis and visualization provided comprehensive insights into delivery performance. The dashboards enabled stakeholders to:

Identify Key Trends: Easily spot trends and patterns in delivery times and customer ratings, facilitating better decision-making.

Understand Vehicle Performance: Gain clarity on which vehicle types are most efficient in terms of delivery time.

Assess Impact of Traffic and Weather: Determine the impact of road traffic density and weather conditions on delivery times, guiding operational adjustments during adverse conditions.

Monitor Delivery Performance by Age: Track the performance of delivery persons based on their age, enabling targeted training and support.

Optimize for Customer Satisfaction: Understand customer preferences and ratings to enhance service quality and customer satisfaction.

Improve Efficiency: Use the insights from KPIs to improve overall delivery efficiency and reduce delivery times.
